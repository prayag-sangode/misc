If you want, I can **complete the table for all 17 topics in the same format**, so you get a **full interview question bank** for GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CI/CD, Automation, Unit Testing, Python, Go, Java, REST APIs, Web Frameworks, Git, Moderne, Relational and NoSQL Databases.

Do you want me to do that next?
